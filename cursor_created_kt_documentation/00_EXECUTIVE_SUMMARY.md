## What is HashInsight?

HashInsight is an enterprise-grade web application platform designed for Bitcoin mining operations. Think of it as a comprehensive "mission control center" for mining farms that helps owners, operators, and investors make smarter decisions about their mining operations.

### In Simple Terms

Imagine you're running a Bitcoin mining operation. You need to:
- **Calculate profitability** - Will this investment make money?
- **Track your equipment** - What miners do I have? Are they working?
- **Manage customers** - Who are my hosting clients? What are they paying?
- **Make predictions** - What will Bitcoin prices do next week?
- **Optimize operations** - How do I handle power outages to minimize losses?

HashInsight does all of this in one integrated platform.
