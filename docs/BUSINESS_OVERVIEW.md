## The Problem We Solve

Running a Bitcoin mining operation today involves juggling multiple disconnected tools:

| Challenge | Traditional Approach | HashInsight Solution |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Monitoring hundreds of miners | Manual checks, multiple dashboards | Unified real-time monitoring with automated alerts |
| Detecting equipment failures | Waiting until something breaks | AI predicts failures 24 hours before they happen |
| Calculating profitability | Spreadsheets with stale data | Dual-algorithm analysis with live market data |
| Managing client relationships | Emails, phone calls, separate CRM | Built-in CRM with client self-service portal |
| Controlling energy costs | Guesswork and manual scheduling | Smart power curtailment with automated scheduling |
| Ensuring security & compliance | Patchwork of tools | SOC2-ready security framework built in |
| Reporting to stakeholders | Hours of manual report creation | One-click professional reports (PDF, Excel, PowerPoint) |

## Platform Capabilities

### 1. Mining Profitability Intelligence

Make smarter investment decisions with data you can trust.

- **Dual-Algorithm Verification** — Two independent calculation methods cross-check each other, so you know the numbers are right
- **Live Market Integration** — Automatically pulls real-time BTC price, network difficulty, and block rewards
- **ROI & Breakeven Analysis** — Instantly see when your investment pays off under different scenarios
- **Batch Equipment Analysis** — Compare profitability across different miner models side by side
- **Sensitivity Modeling** — See how changes in electricity cost, BTC price, or difficulty affect your bottom line

### 2. Real-Time Fleet Monitoring

See every miner's status at a glance — temperature, hashrate, fan speed, board health.

- **Unified Dashboard** — One screen to monitor your entire fleet across all sites
- **4-Tier Data Architecture** — From second-by-second raw data to daily summaries, every level of detail when you need it
- **KPI Tracking** — Uptime, hashrate utilization, power efficiency, and more
- **Site-Level Views** — Drill down into individual sites, zones, and machines
- **Mobile Ready** — Monitor your operation from anywhere on any device

### 3. AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance

Don't wait for failures — prevent them.

- **11 Health Detection Rules** — Covering critical failures (overheating, offline, zero hashrate) to gradual degradation
- **Smart Debouncing** — No false alarms; issues must persist before triggering alerts
- **24-Hour Failure Prediction** — Machine learning models forecast equipment failures before they happen
- **Automated Response** — The AI can diagnose problems, draft repair tickets, and even execute fixes autonomously
- **Budget-Controlled Notifications** — Critical issues always get through; lower-priority items are batched to avoid alert fatigue

**The AI Closed Loop:**
```
Detect → Diagnose → Recommend → Approve → Execute → Audit → Learn
```
The system gets smarter over time, learning from every incident to improve future predictions.
