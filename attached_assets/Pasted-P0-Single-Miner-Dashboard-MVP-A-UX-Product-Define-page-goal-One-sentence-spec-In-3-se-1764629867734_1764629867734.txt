P0 – Single Miner Dashboard MVP（必须做）
A. UX / Product

Define page goal

One sentence spec:

“In 3 seconds, user can see if this miner is healthy and profitable today.”

Finalize sections & fields

Header: Miner name, status, model, location, last seen.

KPI cards (4):

Hashrate (current vs expected)

Temperature range

Power (kW, estimated)

Net Profit / Day

24h chart:

Left axis: Hashrate (TH/s)

Right axis: Net Profit (USD)

Mining Pool block:

Pool URL, Worker name, Latency, Accepted/Rejected (24h)

Optional: Board Health summary (4/4 healthy)

Draw a simple wireframe

One mobile view + one desktop view (hand sketch or Figma, anything is fine).

B. Data / Backend

Define MinerStatus data model

Fields:
hashrate_current, hashrate_expected, temp_min, temp_max,
power_kw, efficiency_j_per_th, error_rate, boards_healthy,
pool_url, worker_name, latency_ms, shares_accepted_24h, shares_rejected_24h.

Implement Antminer status collector (read-only)

Connect to miner API (HTTP JSON or existing adapter).

Map raw fields → MinerStatus model.

Store last N samples (e.g., 24h, 5 min interval).

Compute business metrics

From existing ROI engine, expose:

revenue_day_usd

power_cost_day_usd

net_profit_day_usd

Attach to MinerStatus.

Create API endpoint

GET /api/miner/:id/status → returns MinerStatus + 24h timeseries.

C. Frontend

Build Single Miner page route

URL pattern: /miners/:id.

Implement header block

Show name, status badge (Online/Warning/Offline), model, location, last seen.

Implement KPI row

4 cards with:

Big number

Unit

Small subtext (e.g. Expected 194.3 TH/s, Rev $23.5 – Power $11.2).

Implement combined 24h chart

X: time (24h)

Y-left: Hashrate

Y-right: Net Profit

Toggle not needed yet (only 24h).

Implement Mining Pool block

Show: Pool URL, Worker, Latency, Accepted/Rejected (24h).

Style simple, no extra graphs.

Optional: Board Health (collapsible)

Default: one line Boards: 4 / 4 healthy.

Expand: small list per board (TH/s + temp range).

D. Quality / Polish

Define health rules

Online/Warning/Offline based on:

Last seen time

Temperature thresholds

Error rate

Hashrate deviation from expected

Add basic tests

Backend unit test: mapping raw miner data → MinerStatus.

Frontend snapshot / simple render tests for KPI row and chart.

Review on real device

Open one real miner from test site.

Check:

Loads under 2–3s.

Numbers look reasonable vs existing panels (Foreman / Super Saiyan).
